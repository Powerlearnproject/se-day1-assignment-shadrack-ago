Three Key Milestones in Software Engineering
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

Introduced at the NATO Conference to address the software crisis, where projects were failing due to poor planning and lack of structured processes.
Impact: Led to structured programming and better project management techniques.
The Waterfall Model (1970s)

Introduced by Winston Royce, it established a linear, step-by-step approach to software development (Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance).
Impact: Provided a structured development process, improving project organization and predictability.
The Rise of Agile Development (2001)

The Agile Manifesto emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.
Impact: Made software development faster and more adaptive, leading to popular frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.





List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning 

Defines project goals, scope, budget, and feasibility.
Ensures alignment with business objectives.
Requirements Analysis 

Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements.
Involves stakeholders to ensure clarity.
Design 

Creates architecture, UI/UX, and system models.
Defines database structure and technology stack.
Implementation (Coding) 

Developers write and integrate the actual code based on the design.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Testing 

Identifies and fixes bugs, ensuring functionality and security.
